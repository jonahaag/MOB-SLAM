## Sofa Viewer

Based on a past version of [psomers3/QSofaGLViewTools](https://github.com/psomers3/QSofaGLViewTools) this is a small PyQt widget library for viewing SOFA simulation cameras and controlling them.

All of the used components are described in [gui.md](gui.md) and [mainwindow.py](../src/gui/mainwindow.py) in greater detail.
